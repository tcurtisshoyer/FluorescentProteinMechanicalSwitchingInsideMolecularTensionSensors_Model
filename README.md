Code for Deterministic (ODE) and Stochastic Models of the mechanical switching of fluorescent proteins inside load-bearing proteinss and molecular tension sensors (MTSs) developed in Shoyer et al., Cell Rep Methods, 2024 [doi: 10.1016/j.crmeth.2024.100815]. Analytical solutions and stochastic simulations are implemented in MATLAB.

Here I describe the contents of each folder:

Code for ES framework applied to MTS is located here:
